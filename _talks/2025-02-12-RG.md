A talk I gave as a part of the weekly reading group meetings of the [SOC Group](https://zhengy09.github.io/soclab.html), giving an overview of some interesting results on the exactness of Shor's semidefinite relaxation for QCQPs.

A copy of the slides can be found [here](/files/RobustRelaxations.pdf).
