A few problems I thought about while working.

# Every Orthonormal Basis Has the Same Size
Interestingly, this proof actually requires two different proofs in the finite and infinite dimensional cases.

## Finite Dimensions
This is basically the star result of finite-dimensional linear algebra, in particular the [Steinitz Exchange Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinitz_exchange_lemma).

## Infinite Dimensions
We will assume we are working in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $H$.
Let $\{v_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ and $\{w_\beta\}_{\beta\in B}$ are two bases of the space.
Now, define 
$$E_\beta = \{ \alpha\in A : \langle w_\beta, v_\alpha\rangle \neq 0 \}.$$
Since $\|w_\beta\|^2 = \sum_{\alpha\in A} |\langle w_\beta, v_\alpha\rangle |$, we know that $E_\beta$ is countable.
Moreover, $A = \bigcup_{\beta\in B}E_\beta$.
If not, then there would exist $\alpha$ such that $\langle w_\beta, v_\alpha\rangle = 0$ for all $\beta$, implying that $v_\alpha = 0$ by [Parseval's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parseval%27s_identity).
This clearly cannot happen.

Thus,
$$ |A| = \left| \bigcup_{\beta\in B} E_{\beta}\right| \leq |\mathbb{N}\times B | = |B|.$$
We are using the fact if $B$ is infinite then $|\mathbb{N} \times B| = |B|$ and the fact that each $E_\beta$ is at most countable.
However, nothing here was special about the role of $A$ and $B$, so reversing the argument shows that $|A| \leq |B|$ and $|B|\leq |A|$.
Applying the [Cantor-Schr√∂der-Bernstein theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem) completes the result.

## Corollary: $\ell^2(A) \cong \ell^2(B)$ if and only if $|A| = |B|$
This follows from noting that $\{\chi_{\{\alpha\}}\}_{\alpha\in A}$ and $\{\chi_{\{\beta\}}\}_{\beta\in B}$ form orthonormal bases of their respective spaces.
