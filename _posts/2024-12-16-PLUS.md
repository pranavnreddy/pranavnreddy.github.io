Recently, I completed [CSE 141L](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse141l) this past quarter.
I thought the project was fun and interesting, so I decided to write up my thoughts, as well as an overview of my design.

# Architecture
The architecture I chose to work with is basically just an accumulator machine. There are 16 8-bit registers, and the instruction size is 9 bits.
Nothing particularly special is going on here the only thing of interest is that there is no branch offset, only direct branching is allowed.
I did this because the test programs were small enough that I didn't need to implement anything other than this.

## Instruction Types
| Type    | Format | Instructions |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | 
| R  | (Opcode 4)\_(Register)\_(Opcode 1)    | `and`, `nand`, `nor`, `add`, `sub`, `lsr`, `lsrd`, `lsl`, `lsld`, `asr`, `rot`, `pop`, `popn`, `push`, `pushn`
| M |   (Opcode 4)\_(Address 5)   | `ldw`, `stw`
| B    |  (Opcode 4)\_(Label 5)  | `bze`, `buc`, `bgt`, `blt`, `bov`
| N    | (Opcode 4)\_XXXXX    | `nop`


# Future Directions
This design is pretty basic and uninteresting to be honest, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, given that I built this in a ~16 hour session.
If I ever feel like it I'll add a pipeline and some commands to make it a ``real'' CPU.
