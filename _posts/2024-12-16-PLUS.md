Recently, I completed [CSE 141L](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse141l) this past quarter.
I thought the project was fun and interesting, so I decided to write up my thoughts, as well as an overview of my design.

# Architecture
The architecture I chose to work with is basically just an accumulator machine. There are 16 8-bit general purpose registers, and the instruction size is 9 bits.
Nothing particularly special is going on here the only thing of interest is that there is no branch offset, only direct branching is allowed.
I did this because the test programs were small enough that I didn't need to implement anything other than this.

# Instruction Types

| Type    | Format | Instructions |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | 
| R  | (Opcode 4)\_(Register)\_(Opcode 1)    | `and`, `orr`, `nand`, `nor`, `add`, `sub`, `lsr`, `lsrd`, `lsl`, `lsld`, `asr`, `rot`, `pop`, `popn`, `push`, `pushn`
| M |   (Opcode 4)\_(Address 5)   | `ldw`, `stw`
| B    |  (Opcode 4)\_(Label 5)  | `bze`, `buc`, `bgt`, `blt`, `bov`
| N    | (Opcode 4)\_XXXXX    | `nop`

# Instructions
I'll use `acc` to denote the accumulator register(`r0`), and `rN` to denote register N.

| Instruction | Format | Description |
| ------- | -------| ------ |
| `and` | `and rN` | Bitwise logical AND of `r0` and `rN`, outputs result into `r0`. |
| `orr` | `orr rN` | Bitwise logical OR of `r0` and `rN`, outputs result into `r0`. |
| `nand` | `nand rN` | Bitwise logical NAND of `r0` and `rN`, outputs result into `r0`. |
| `nor` | `nor rN` | Bitwise logical NOR of `r0` and `rN`, outputs result into `r0`. |
| `add` | `add rN` | Adds `r0` `rN`, outputs result into `r0`. Will set overflow flag if result has unsigned overflow. |
| `sub` | `sub rN` | Does `r0 - rN`, outputs result into `r0`. Will set overflow flag if result has signed overflow. |
| `lsr` | `lsr rN` | Logical right shift of `r0` by `rN`, outputs result into `r0`. Dropped off bit is placed into dropoff flag. |
| `lsrd` | `lsrd rN` | Logical right shift of `r0` by `rN`, outputs result into `r0`, and loads dropoff flag into leftmost bit. Dropped off bit is placed into dropoff flag. |
| `lsl` | `lsr rN` | Logical left shift of `r0` by `rN`, outputs result into `r0`. |
| `lsld` | `lsld rN` | Logical left shift of `r0` by `rN`, outputs result into `r0`, and loads dropoff flag into rightmost bit. Dropped off bit is placed into dropoff flag. |
| `asr` | `asr rN` | Arithmetic right shift of `r0` by `rN`. Dropped off bit is placed into dropoff flag. |
| `rot` | `rot rN` | Shift left with rotate of `r0` by `rN`. |
| `pop` | `pop rN` | Loads value of `r0` into `rN`|
| `popn` | `popn rN` | Logically negates, then loads value of `r0` into `rN`. |
| `push` | `push rN` | Loads value of `rN` into `r0`. |
| `pushn` | `pushn rN` | Logically negates, then loads value of `rN` into `r0`. |
| `ldw` | `ldw <addr>` | Loads the value at address `addr` into `r0`. Assembler throws error if `addr` is more than 5 bits wide. |
| `stw` | `ldw <addr>` | Stores the value of `r0` into the address `addr`. Assembler throws error if `addr` is more than 5 bits wide. |
| `bze` | `bze <insn>` | Branches to the instruction given by `insn` if `r0` is currently 0. Equivalently, branches if the zero flag is high. Assembler throws error if `insn` is more than 5 bits wide. |
| `bgt` | `bgt <insn>` | Branches to the instruction given by `insn` if `r0` is positive (when viewed as a 2's complement integer). Equivalently, branches if the positive flag is high. Assembler throws error if `insn` is more than 5 bits wide. |
| `blt` | `blt <insn>` | Branches to the instruction given by `insn` if `r0` is negative (when viewed as a 2's complement integer). Equivalently, branches if the negative flag is high. Assembler throws error if `insn` is more than 5 bits wide. |
| `bov` | `blt <insn>` | Branches to the instruction given by `insn` if the overflow flag is high. This may be meaningless if the last instruction was not `add` or `sub`. Assembler throws error if `insn` is more than 5 bits wide. |
| `buc` | `buc <insn>` | Unconditionally branches to the instruction given by `insn`. Assembler throws error if `insn` is more than 5 bits wide. |
| `nop` | `nop` | Does nothing. |

I also wrote a small assembler with some nice features like C-style macros and (hopefully) good debug messages.
ARM should hire me.

# Future Directions
This design is pretty basic and uninteresting to be honest, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, given that I built this in a ~16 hour session.
If I ever feel like it I'll add a pipeline and some commands to make it a "real" CPU, and probably make the assembler more robust, as well as add real branching features (lookup tables, etc).
